LineStyling properties + desc from docs:

General 
clip - 	How to clip relative to chartArea. Positive value allows overflow, negative value clips that many pixels inside chartArea. 0 = clip at chartArea. Clipping can also be configured per side: clip: {left: 5, top: false, right: -2, bottom: 0}
indexAxis - The base axis of the dataset. 'x' for horizontal lines and 'y' for vertical lines.
label -The label for the dataset which appears in the legend and tooltips.
order - The drawing order of dataset. Also affects order for stacking, tooltip and legend
stack - The ID of the group to which this dataset belongs to (when stacked, each group will be a separate stack).
xAxisID - The ID of the x-axis to plot this dataset on
yAxisID - The ID of the y-axis to plot this dataset on


Points 
pointBackgroundColor - 	The fill color for points.
pointBorderColor - The border color for points.
pointBorderWidth - The width of the point border in pixels.
pointHitRadius - The pixel size of the non-displayed point that reacts to mouse events
pointRadius - The radius of the point shape. If set to 0, the point is not rendered
pointRotation - The rotation of the point in degrees
pointStyle - "circle || cross || crossRot || dash || line || rect || rectRounded || star || triangle"

Lines
backgroundColor - The line fill color
borderCapStyle - Cap style of the line  "butt" || "round" || "square"
borderColor - The line color
borderDash - Length and spacing of dashes
borderDashOffset - Offset for line dashes
borderJoinStyle - Line joint style
borderWidth - The line width
fill - How to fill the area under the line
tension - Bezier curve tension of the line. Set to 0 to draw straightlines. This option is ignored if monotone cubic interpolation is used.
showLine - If false, the line is not drawn for this dataset.
spanGaps - 	If true, lines will be drawn between points with no or null data. If false, points with null data will create a break in the line. Can also be a number specifying the maximum gap length to span. The unit of the value depends on the scale used.
